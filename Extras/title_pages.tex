In preparing this thesis, I was in contact with many people, researchers,
academicians, and practitioners. They have contributed towards my understanding and
thoughts. In particular, I wish to express my sincere appreciation to my main thesis
supervisor, Professor Dr. Mohd Shariff Nabi Baksh, for encouragement, guidance, critics
and friendship. I am also very thankful to my co-supervisors Professor Dr. Awaluddin
Mohd Shaharoun and Associate Professor Dr. Hishamuddin Jamaluddin for their
guidance, advices and motivation. Without their continued support and interest, this
thesis would not have been the same as presented here.

Librarians at Bahria University also deserve special thanks for their
assistance in supplying the relevant literatures. My fellow postgraduate students
should also be recognised for their support. My sincere appreciation also extends to
all my colleagues and others who have provided assistance at various occasions.
Their views and tips are useful indeed. Unfortunately, it is not possible to list all of
them in this limited space. I am grateful to all my family members.
