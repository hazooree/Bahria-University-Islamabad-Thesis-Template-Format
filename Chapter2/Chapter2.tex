\chapter{\textsc{Related Work}}

Literature review is a systematic method of identifying, evaluating and interpreting the
work (similar to yours) produced by others. This chapter should set the project into context
and give the proposed layout for achieving the project goals. It is an important chapter
especially if the project involves significant amount of ground work. Review prior work
critically, identify gaps in knowledge/areas of application and build an argument for your
own work. When referring to other pieces of work, cite the sources where they are referred
to or used, rather than just listing them at the end \cite{symeonidis2014transitive}.

\section{Sample of Quotation in Text}
After deliberating on doctoral education in Australia in the 1990s, one
observer I Australia writes:

\blockquote{\textit{The lack of any significant formal course work within our MS/M.Phil and
master degrees by research has continued for three decades. The focus
of our MS/M.Phil research type degrees continues to be the research
project, and this is almost the only medium by which education is
accomplished.
